            When many people start learning how to write a bio, they skip this important part. People need to know
            who you are before they learn what you do. Remember that your most important details should go in the
            very first sentence.
            What you consider to be “important details” can change depending on where you decide to publish this
            bio. When you have more space, share something personal about who you are. A passion, a core value, an
            outlook on life – something that speaks to you as a holistic person.
            A personal bio should include essentials like your job title, industry and location. From a search
            results standpoint, you want your name to be associated with your location, job title and industry.
            This way, people looking for you in a professional capacity can find you associated with those words
            immediately.

            WIt’s important to showcase yourself more fully so that people can get a sense of who you are when they
            look you up online. Aim to describe yourself in a way that’s professional… but also, human.
